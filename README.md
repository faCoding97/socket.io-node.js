About Socket.io:
Socket.io is a JavaScript library that enables real-time, bi-directional communication between a server and its clients over the web. It is built on top of the WebSocket protocol, which provides a full-duplex communication channel between a web browser and a server.

Socket.io offers a number of features, such as:

Event-driven communication: Socket.io uses an event-driven architecture, where events can be emitted and received by the server and the clients.
Room-based communication: Socket.io enables clients to join or leave "rooms", which can be used to group clients together and broadcast messages to specific groups of clients.
Broadcasting: Socket.io provides a number of methods for broadcasting messages to clients, including broadcasting to all clients, broadcasting to all clients in a specific room, or broadcasting to all clients except the sender.
Socket.io can be used with a variety of web frameworks and technologies, including Node.js, Express, React, and Angular. It is widely used for real-time applications, such as chat applications, online gaming, and collaborative editing tools.
